Packrat is a simple inventory item tracker addon for Ashita V4.  Open up its configuration, select the items you'd like to track, and enjoy!

This Addon is depreciated but [Thorny](https://github.com/ThornyFFXI) added the ability to check Wardrobe and Wardrobe 2

As of 2/2/2025 it still currently works on Horizon's private server with Ashita v4
