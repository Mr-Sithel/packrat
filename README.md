### Info

Packrat was originally created and maintained by colorglut, who no longer seems to be active.
I added the addon here to keep it alive but it is no longer maintained aside from the addition of tracking Wardrobe and Wardrobe 2 by [Thorny](https://github.com/ThornyFFXI).

Packrat is a simple inventory item tracker addon for Ashita V4.  Open up its configuration, select the items you'd like to track, and enjoy!

As of 2/2/2025 it still currently works on Horizon's private server with Ashita v4

Great for tracking:

* Food
* Ammunition
* Ninja tools
* Bait
* Beastmen/Kindred Seals
* Misc. consumables
* Scrolls
* Crystals
* ...and more!

### Installation

* Download and unzip the latest version of Packrat at https://github.com/Mr-Sithel/packrat/releases/
* Copy the `packrat` folder inside of the `packrat-main` folder into your Ashita addons directory
* You can load the addon by typing `/load addon packrat`.  It is recommended you add this line to the appropriate place in `scripts/default.txt`
